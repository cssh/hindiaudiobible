Hindi Audio Bible
=================

This is the git contolled version  of the website. By design, this is meant
to be a single html page with the CSS embedded in the file itself. This should
make creating multiple redundant copies of the front end trivial since it can
be as simple as emailing the html file around to whoever wants a copy. The
backend audio files are currently hosted on Google drive.
